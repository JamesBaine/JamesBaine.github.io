EXTRA: NumberChecker 

If any additional time remains, slack out the following activity. This activity is useful for students in completing the homework, but it is not necessary for them to complete it in class.

Instructions:

Using the displayed application as an example, create code in which:

A computer picks a random number between 1 and 4

Users then "click" buttons numbered 1 – 4.

If the user's number matches the computer's number, display text informing them that they won in the Result panel. Otherwise, display text informing them that they lost.

If you finish early, try to improve the aesthetics.
